< Own Your Expertise / Writing > 
==================================
Something to note throughout the majority of this session: just barf it out, and edit it later. Meaning, the focus for this should not be perfection, but just flow. Shush your inner critic.

Step 2: Writing 1-2 Article Ideas/Outlines (15 min)
---------------------------------------------------

Suggestions on what to write about
- reflections on the learning process, 
- bugs you’ve come across and how you’ve fixed them, 
- tutorials on lesser-known languages and technologies,
- updates on your progress on your coding projects. 
- “Every time you spend more than five minutes fixing a bug, you should write about it" -Debra Williams Cauley at WSC 2013 ([more](http://www.writespeakcode.com/blog/2013/11/16/so-you-wanna-write-tech-books.html))

Step 3: Feedback (5 min)
---------------------------------------------------
Let's spend a few minutes to get into groups of 2-3, to get feedback from each other.

Step 4: Writing your blog entry (20 min)
---------------------------------------------------
You'll have 30 minutes in total to write, but we'll do a 2 minute check-in with your group 20 minutes in.

Step 5: Quick feedback/check-in (2 min)
---------------------------------------------------
Let's quickly check-in with each other - need help with flow, storyline, etc?

Step 6: Finish up blog entry (10 min)
---------------------------------------------------
Most likely we won't finish the blog entries 100% today. But let's at least try to finish up the framework, so it's easy to finish up later.

Step 7: Let's share our work! (3 min)
---------------------------------------------------
Let's take this time to share what we did with each other: <https://pad.riseup.net/p/WSC2014>
