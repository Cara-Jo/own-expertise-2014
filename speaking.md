-   Meetups: ask organizers, discussion groups or mailing lists
-   Where do your leaders in your industry/community speak?

Step 2: Write up a talk proposal (25 min)
-----------------------------------------

Proposals typically consist of:
-   Title
    -   Get people interested and excited
    -   Be vague enough that you have wiggle room when creating your presentation
    -   Be specific enough that readers know what you’re talking about
-   Description
    -   What’s the main idea? What are some sub­-topics? What’s the conclusion?
    -   What will the audience come away with?
    -   Some people include bullet points with a rough outline of the talk
    -   Keep people interested
    -   Be vague and specific :)
    -   Show the reviewer that your talk has substance
-   Outline

Step 3: Get Feedback & Adjust (30 min)
--------------------------------------
Get into small groups (2-4) and get/give feedback. Adjust proposals as needed.

Feedback to give when reviewing proposals:

1.  Do you understand what this talk is about?
2.  Does it have enough relevance to attendees? ("What's in it for me?")
3.  Will this talk fit in the time allotted?
4.  Has this person thought through all the points they want to make?
5.  Would you want to see this talk?

Step 4: Let's share our work! (5 min)
--------------------------------------

What do I do after today?
--------------------------------------
-   Finish and submit your proposal *(you may or may not get a proposal accepted on the first try - don't get discouraged! If at first you don't succeed, try try again :) )*
-   Find opportunities to practice
    -   your friends, coworkers, in front of your mirror, record then watch yourself
    -   reach out to meetups
